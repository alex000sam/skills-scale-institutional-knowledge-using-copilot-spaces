- [ ] CI green for all merged changes; security scans passed
- [ ] Integration and smoke tests executed in staging
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and validated
- [ ] Release notes drafted and reviewed (Technical Writer + PdM)
- [ ] Release window scheduled and communicated to stakeholders
- [ ] Support / On-call notified and runbooks updated
- [ ] Feature flags and rollout plan defined (if applicable)
- [ ] Release Manager approval obtained

Deployment
- [ ] Backup / snapshot (if applicable)
- [ ] Automated pipeline executed or manual steps followed
- [ ] Post-deploy smoke tests executed
- [ ] Verify key metrics and health checks

Post-release
- [ ] Confirm success with stakeholders and support
- [ ] Publish release notes to external/internal channels
- [ ] Update the Risk Register with any new observations
